Project for the Statistical Machine Learning course

## Abstract

The classification project for the 1RT700 course in statistical machine learning is
contained in this document. The problem is identifying the gender of Hollywood
filmsâ€™ two lead actors (one male, one female). For this, we are provided a training
set of 1039 movies and we want to see whether certain features, such as the amount
of dialogue the actors have, the year the film was made, and others, can predict the
gender of the leading actor in a movie. In this project, we choose from a variety of
models, one model to use in production against a test set. After comparing several
models we have come to the conclusion that the model that works best for this
set of data is a quadratic discriminant analysis with feature selection. The project
concludes with a
